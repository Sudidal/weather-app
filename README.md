My template for web pages Initialized with:

1- Webpack,
2- babel,
3- eslint,
4- prettier,

this project took 7 days of work to complete and here is what i learned

1- this project main focus was on learning web apis and sending requests and i learned it good
2- i learned some styling facts
3- i learned about code organizing since this project needed multiple script files
4- i learned that images should be requested from a server not installed on the local project folder

I'm happy with results since the main focus was a simple user friendly design and that what was the result
